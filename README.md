# JavaScript Interview Questions

## 1. What is the difference between `this` in JavaScript when used in strict mode versus non-strict mode?

### Answer:
```javascript
// Non-strict mode
function myFunction() {
  console.log(this); // Output: Window object (or global object)
}

myFunction();

// Strict mode
"use strict";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(this); // Output: undefined
}

myFunction();
```

### Explanation:
- **Non-strict mode:** When `this` is used in a standalone function, it usually refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in a browser).
- **Strict mode:** In strict mode, `this` defaults to `undefined` in a standalone function, helping avoid reliance on the global object.

### Key Points:
- `this` is determined by how a function is called, not where it's declared.
- Arrow functions inherit `this` from the surrounding scope.
- Strict mode introduces stricter rules, making code more robust.

## 2. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.

### Answer:
```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;
```

### Explanation:
- **Variable Declarations:** In JavaScript, variable declarations (`var`) are hoisted to the top of their scope.
- **Initialization:** The initialization happens later, so accessing the variable before itâ€™s assigned results in `undefined`.

### Key Points:
- Function declarations are hoisted.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted but remain in a "temporal dead zone" before declaration, causing a `ReferenceError`.

---

## 3. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?

### Answer:
```javascript
// var: Function scope, can be re-declared and reassigned
var x = 10;
var x = 20; // Re-declared and reassigned

// let: Block scope, cannot be re-declared but can be reassigned
let y = 10;
// let y = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
y = 20; // Reassigned

// const: Block scope, cannot be re-declared or reassigned
const z = 10;
// const z = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'z' has already been declared
// z = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

### Key Differences:
- **Scope:**
  - `var`: Function-scoped.
  - `let` and `const`: Block-scoped.
- **Redeclaration:**
  - `var`: Can be redeclared.
  - `let` and `const`: Cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
- **Reassignment:**
  - `var` and `let`: Can be reassigned.
  - `const`: Cannot be reassigned.

### Best Practices:
- Use `let` and `const` for better scoping and immutability control.

## 4. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript.

### Answer:

**Synchronous Code Execution:**
- Executes line by line, blocking until the current task finishes.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  console.log('Step 1');
  console.log('Step 2');
  console.log('Step 3');
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Step 1
  Step 2
  Step 3
  ```

**Asynchronous Code Execution:**
- Allows code to execute without waiting for long-running operations.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  console.log('Step 1');

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Step 2 - After 2 seconds');
  }, 2000);

  console.log('Step 3');
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Step 1
  Step 3
  Step 2 - After 2 seconds
  ```

### Key Points:
- Asynchronous programming allows handling I/O operations (e.g., AJAX requests) without blocking the main thread.

## 5. What are unit tests, and why are they important in JavaScript development?

### Answer:

**Unit Tests:**
- Tests small, isolated pieces of code (usually functions or methods).
- Purpose: To verify correctness and ensure that each part of the code functions as expected.

### Key Benefits:
- **Early Bug Detection:** Identifies bugs early, reducing the cost of fixing them.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Encourages writing modular, testable code.
- **Increased Confidence:** Assures that changes do not break existing functionality.

### Example:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

## 6. What is the purpose of the Module Pattern in JavaScript?

### Answer:

**Module Pattern:**
- Creates self-contained, modular code with public and private variables/methods.
- Helps with **encapsulation**, **namespace management**, and **code organization**.

### Example:
```javascript
const myModule = (() => {
  let privateVar = 'Hello';

  function privateFunction() {
    console.log(privateVar);
  }

  return {
    publicVar: 'World',
    publicFunction: () => {
      console.log(publicVar + ' ' + privateVar);
    }
  };
})();
```

### Benefits:
- Improved code organization and reduced naming conflicts.
- Public API exposed while keeping implementation details hidden.

---

## 7. Explain the concept of Promises in JavaScript.

### Answer:

**Promises:**
- A promise represents a value that may be available in the future, or an error if something went wrong.
- **States:**
  - **Pending:** Initial state.
  - **Fulfilled:** Operation completed successfully.
  - **Rejected:** Operation failed.

### Example:
```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Data fetched');
    }, 1000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Key Points:
- Promises allow for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

---

## 8. What is the Observer Pattern, and how can it be implemented in JavaScript?

### Answer:

**Observer Pattern:**
- Defines a one-to-many dependency where one object (the subject) notifies multiple objects (observers) about changes.

### Example:
```javascript
class Subject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  subscribe(observer) {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  unsubscribe(observer) {
    this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);
  }

  notify(data) {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(data));
  }
}

class Observer {
  update(data) {
    console.log('Observer received:', data);
  }
}

const subject = new Subject();
const observer1 = new Observer();
subject.subscribe(observer1);
subject.notify('Data changed');
```

### Benefits:
- Loose coupling between subject and observers, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.

## 9. Can you explain how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM)?

### Answer:
```javascript
// Access an element by ID
const myElement = document.getElementById('myElementId');

// Change text content
myElement.textContent = 'New text content';

// Modify style
myElement.style.color = 'blue';
myElement.style.fontSize = '20px';

// Add/Remove classes
myElement.classList.add('myClass');
myElement.classList.remove('myClass');

// Create new elements and append them
const newElement = document.createElement('p');
newElement.textContent = 'This is a new paragraph.';
myElement.appendChild(newElement);
```

### Key Points:
- **Accessing Elements:** Methods like `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`.
- **Modifying DOM:** Change content, styles, attributes, or even create new elements.
- **Event Handling:** Attach event listeners to DOM elements for interactivity.
